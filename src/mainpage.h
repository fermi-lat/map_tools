	SkyImage, with parameters from class CountMapParameters, data selection from class SkyMap
    - exposure_cube, defined in exposure_cube.cxx. Also uses  CountMapParameters, Exposure. Create a hypercube 
    in ra, dec, costheta, save as a multi-image FITS file.
    - exposure_map, defined in exposure_map.cxx. Also uses SkyImage, MapParameters, Exposure. 
    Read in a hypercube, make a sky map using a basic function to describe the effective area vs. angle.
